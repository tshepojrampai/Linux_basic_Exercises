Task 1 : Basic Task

Open a linux terminal. Now do the following from the command line.

1. 
recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~$ ls
 Desktop                                  myProject            summary.txt
 Documents                                node_modules         Templates
 Downloads                                Personal-Website     umuzi.txt
 excercise.txt                            Pictures             Videos
 google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb   
 Music                                    search_results.txt
 myDoccument                              search_result.txt

ls function list all the directories and files in a working directory.

2. recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~$ pwd
/home/recruit

pwd means print working directory, it prints the path of the working directory

3. recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~$ mkdir workspace

4. recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~$ cd workspace
recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~/workspace$ ls
recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~$

This means there is no file or subdirectory in the workspace directory hence nothing was returned.

5. recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~/workspace$ touch README.md

6. recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~/workspace$ README.md CHANGELOG.md




 Task 2 : Absolute and Relative Paths

recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~/workspace$ touch exercise.md
recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~/workspace$ mv exercise.md /tmp
recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~/workspace$ rm /home/recruit/workspace/exercise.md

1. recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~$ touch umuzi.md cohort.md recruit.md
2. recruit@recruit-Mecer-X102:~/cat_commands$ cat>umuzi.md

Sonnet 116: Let me not to the marriage of true minds 
BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE
Let me not to the marriage of true minds 
Admit impediments. Love is not love 
Which alters when it alteration finds, 
Or bends with the remover to remove. 
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark 
That looks on tempests and is never shaken; 
It is the star to every wand'ring bark, 
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. 
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks 
Within his bending sickle's compass come; 
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, 
But bears it out even to the edge of doom. 
If this be error and upon me prov'd, 
I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.^Z

Invictus 
BY WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY
Out of the night that covers me, 
      Black as the pit from pole to pole, 
I thank whatever gods may be 
      For my unconquerable soul. 

In the fell clutch of circumstance 
      I have not winced nor cried aloud. 
Under the bludgeonings of chance 
      My head is bloody, but unbowed. 

Beyond this place of wrath and tears 
      Looms but the Horror of the shade, 
And yet the menace of the years 
      Finds and shall find me unafraid. 

It matters not how strait the gate, 
      How charged with punishments the scroll, 
I am the master of my fate, 
      I am the captain of my soul.
